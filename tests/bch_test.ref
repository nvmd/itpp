===================================
    Test of BCH encoder/decoder    
===================================
A two error case (should be corrected)
input =   [0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0]
encoded = [0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0]

decoded = [0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0]
A three error case (will cause decoding errors)
input =   [1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0]
encoded = [1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0]

decoded = [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0]

Systematic case
---------------

========================================
   Systematic decoding failure test     
========================================
all codewords valid? 0
valid codeword? = [0]
A four error case (will cause decoding failure)
input =   [1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0]
encoded = [1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0]
