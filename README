Introduction
************

IT++ is a C++ library of mathematical, signal processing and communication
classes and functions. Its main use is in simulation of communication systems
and for performing research in the area of communications. The kernel of the
library consists of generic vector and matrix classes, and a set of
accompanying routines. Such a kernel makes IT++ similar to MATLAB or GNU
Octave.

The IT++ library originates from the former department of Information Theory
at the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden. Because the
library is coded in C++, the name IT++ seemed like a good idea at the time.
While departments come and go, IT++ have developed a life of it's own and is
now released under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) for you
to enjoy.

IT++ is being developed and widely used by researchers who work in the area
of communications, both in the industry and at universities. In 2005, 2006
and 2007, IT++ was developed as a part of the European Network of Excellence
in Wireless Communications (NEWCOM).

IT++ makes extensive use of existing open-source or commercial libraries
for increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular BLAS, LAPACK
and FFTW libraries can be used. Instead of the reference BLAS and LAPACK
implementations, some optimized platform-specific libraries can be used as
well, i.e.:

  o ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software) - includes optimised
    BLAS and a limited set of LAPACK routines
  o MKL (Intel Math Kernel Library) - includes all required BLAS, LAPACK and
    FFT routines (FFTW not required)
  o ACML (AMD Core Math Library) - includes BLAS, LAPACK and FFT routines
    (FFTW not required)

It is possible to compile and use IT++ without any of the above listed
libraries, but the functionality will be reduced.

IT++ should work on GNU/Linux, Sun Solaris, Microsoft Windows (with Cygwin,
MinGW/MSYS or Microsoft Visual C++) and Mac OS X operating systems.
