In the following sections we describe the naming conventions which are
used for files, classes, structures, local variables, and global variables.


\section cr_variables Default Naming Rules for Variables

Variables are named using lower-case letters and words are separated
using under-score. Abbreviations, when used in variable names, are also
written with lower-case letters. Examples:

<ul>
<li> \c `fft_size' </li>
<li> \c `nrof_paths' </li>
<li> \c `my_variable_name' </li>
</ul>

Some variable names or parts of variable names are commonly used in
several different functions and files to denote the same thing. For
instance the following common names and prefixes should be used:

<ul>
<li> \c `rows' - number of rows in a matrix </li>
<li> \c `cols' - number of columns in a matrix </li>
<li> \c `nrof_' - number of ... </li>
</ul>


\section cr_files Default Naming Rules for Files

Files are named using lower-case letters and words are separated using
under-score. Abbreviations, when used in file names, are also written
with lower-case letters.

Source files are named using <tt>`.cpp'</tt> suffix, whereas header
files end with <tt>`.h'</tt> extension. Examples:

<ul>
<li> <tt>`my_file.h'</tt> </li>
<li> <tt>`my_file.cpp'</tt> </li>
</ul>


\section cr_functions Default Naming Rules for Functions

Function names are named using lower-case letters and words are
separated using under-score. Abbreviations, when used in function
names, are also written with lower-case letters. This rule applies
both to stand-alone functions as well as to member functions of
classes. Example:

<ul>
<li> <tt>int my_function_name(int a, int b)</tt> </li>
</ul>


\section cr_classes Default Naming Rules for Classes and Structures

Each new word in a class or structure name should always start with a
capital letter and the words should be separated with an
under-score. Abbreviations are written with capital letters. Examples:

<ul>
<li> \c `My_Class_Name' </li>
<li> \c	`My_Struct_Name' </li>
<li> \c `OFDM' </li>
</ul>


\section cr_classes_functionality Default Functionality of Classes

All classes that are configured by input parameters should include:

<ul>
<li> default empty constructor </li>
<li> one or more additional constructor(s) that takes input parameters
and initializes the class instance </li>
<li> setup function, preferably named \c `setup' or \c
`set_parameters' </li>
</ul>

Explicit destructor functions are not required, unless they are
needed. It shall not be possible to use any of the other member
functions unless the class has been properly initiated with the input
parameters.
