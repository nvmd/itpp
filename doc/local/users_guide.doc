\section introduction Introduction

The \c itbase library is the core of \c IT++ and it contains classes and
functions for mathematics with scalars, vectors, and matrices. This document
does not cover all the aspects of the \c itbase library. It does however
explain the most important things you need to know in order to start using
IT++. Once you are more familiar with the \c itbase library you will find
the online reference manual more useful.


\section predefined_types Predefined Data Types


\subsection scalar_types Predefined Scalar Types

Apart from the standard C++ types e.g. \c char, \c short, \c int, \c long,
\c double, \c float, and \c long \c long, the following types are specific
for \c IT++:
- \c complex<double>: Contains real and imaginary parts of type \c double
- \c bin: Used for binary (0,1) data


\subsection vector_types Prepared Vector Types

A vector can in principle be of arbitrary type (that support addition,
subtraction, multiplication and division), since the general vector class \c
Vec<TYPE> is templated. However, the most commonly used vector types are
predefined. These predefined vector types are:

- \c vec: Basic vector type containing \c double
- \c cvec: Vector type containing \c complex<double>
- \c ivec: Vector type containing \c int
- \c bvec: Vector type containing \c bin
- \c svec: Vector type containing \c short

The general vector class is used to define the specialized classes above.
The \c vec class is actually a \c Vec<double>. We urge you to use these
predefined classes instead of \c Vec<TYPE> when ever possible.


\subsection matrix_types Prepared Matrix Types

The general matrix class is called \c Mat<TYPE>. These predefined matrix
types are:

- \c mat: Basic matrix type containing double
- \c cmat: Matrix type containing \c complex<double>
- \c imat: Matrix type containing \c int
- \c bmat: Matrix type containing \c bin
- \c smat: Matrix type containing \c short

As with vector, the general matrix class is used to define the specialized
classes above. The \c mat class is thus a \c Mat<double>. We urge you to use
these predefined classes instead of \c Mat<TYPE> whenever possible.


\section using_vectors Using Vectors

Vectors and matrices in \c IT++ are very similar. We therefore begin to
describe the vector class in detail and then briefly explain the differences
regarding matrices in the next section.


\subsection defining_vectors Defining a Vector

A vector containing elements of type \c double is defined with:

\code
vec my_vector;
\endcode

However, this will not assign a size (memory) to the vector. To assign size
10 to the vector we may use:

\code
vec my_vector(10);
\endcode

or

\code
vec my_vector;
my_vector.set_size(10,false);
\endcode

where the second parameter in the \c set_size call (\c true or \c false)
determines if you want to copy the contents of the old data area into the
new resized one, or not. This may be useful when down-sizing a vector, but
in this case it is not. It is also equivalent to use

\code
my_vector.set_length(10,false);
\endcode

instead of \c set_size.

Observe that a declared vector (or matrix) is not cleared (the element
values are undefined). To clear a vector we simply write

\code
my_vector.clear();
\endcode

or

\code
my_vector.zeros();
\endcode

To fill the vector with ones we write

\code
my_vector.ones();
\endcode

It is possible to retrieve the length (size) of a vector in any of the
following ways:

\code
length_of_vector = my_vector.length();
length_of_vector = my_vector.size();
length_of_vector = length(my_vector);
\endcode

To assign values to a vector

\code
vec  a = "0 0.7 5 9.3";        // that is a = [0 0.7 5 9.3]
ivec b = "0:5";                // that is b = [0 1 2 3 4 5]
vec  c = "3:2.5:13";           // that is c = [3 5.5 8 10.5 13]
ivec d = "1:3:5,0:2:4";        // that is d = [1 3 5 0 2 4]
vec e("1.2,3.4,5.6");          // that is e = [1.2 3.4 5.6]
vec f;
f.set("1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0");      // that is f = [1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0]
vec g;
g = f;                         // that is g is a copy of f
\endcode

A comma or a space character separates the vector elements. When assigning
or retrieving a specific vector element use

\code
a(i) = 3.14;
double p = a(i);
\endcode

for element number \a i. Vector elements are numbered such that \a a(0)
denotes the first element. It is also possible to use square brackets as in
the C language, i.e.

\code
a[i] = 3.14;
double p = a[i];
\endcode

Parts or a vector are retrieved by

\code
a.left(3);   // a vector containing the first 3 elements of a
a.right(2);  // a vector containing the last 2 elements of a
a.mid(1,2);  // a vector containing the 2 elements starting with a(1)
a(2,4);      // a vector containing all elements from a(2) to a(4)
a(2,-1);     // a vector containing all elements from a(2) to the end of a
\endcode

Alternatively you can use \a get() methods instead of () or [] operators, e.g.

\code
a.get(4);
a.get(5,-1);
\endcode

If you have a vector called \a index_list containing indexes (\a ivec) you
may write

\code
// these give a vector containing elements with indexes in index_list
a(index_list);
a.get(index_list);
\endcode

If you have a \c bvec called e.g. \a bin_list you may write

\code
// these give a vector containing all elements a(i) for which bin_list(i) equals 1
a(bin_list);
a.get(bin_list);
\endcode

Have a look at the following example:

\code
#include <itpp/itbase.h>
using namespace itpp;
using namespace std;

int main() {
  vec a = linspace(0,1,11);
  ivec index_list = "3 5 2 2";
  bvec bin_list = "1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1";

  cout << "a = " << a << endl;
  cout << "a(index_list) = " << a(index_list) << endl;
  cout << "a.get(bin_list) = " << a.get(bin_list) << endl;
}
\endcode

When you run this program you will see

\code
a = [0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0]
a(index_list) = [0.3 0.5 0.2 0.2]
a.get(bin_list) = [0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0]
\endcode


\subsection vector_manipulation Vector Manipulation

Below follows a listing of the most common vector manipulation commands that
are available. All examples are given for an \c ivec denoted \a my_ivec, but
of course this will work for other vector types as well.

- \c shift_right:
\code
// Shift in scalar data (10) at position 0
my_ivec.shift_right(10);

// Shift in vector at position 0
my_ivec.shift_right("10 4");
\endcode

- \c shift_left:
\code
// Shift in scalar data (10) at position Size()-1
my_ivec.shift_left(10);

// Shift in vector at position Size()-1
my_ivec.shift_left("10 4");
\endcode

- \c set_subvector:
\code
// Replace part of vector from position (10) with the vector "11 13"
my_ivec.set_subvector(10,"11 13");
\endcode

- \c del:
\code
// Delete element at index (10), making vector size one less
my_ivec.del(10);
\endcode

- \c ins:
\code
// Insert element at index (10), making vector size one extra
my_ivec.ins(10);
\endcode

- \c split:
\code
// Splits vector at pos (10). Returns first part, keep second part.
ivec first_part = my_ivec.split(10);
\endcode

- \c elem_mult:
\code
// Multiply two vectors element wise.
ivec my_product = elem_mult(my_invec1,my_ivec2);
\endcode

- \c elem_div:
\code
// Dividide two vectors element wise.
ivec my_product = elem_div(my_invec1,my_ivec2);
\endcode

- Calculation: +, -, *, /
\code
a = my_ivec1 + my_ivec2;  // Addition of vectors
a = my_ivec + 10;         // Addition of vector and scalar
a = my_ivec1 - my_ivec2;  // Subtraction of vectors
a = my_ivec - 10;         // Subtraction of vector and scalar
a = my_ivec * 10;         // Multiplication of vector and scalar
a = my_ivec / 10;         // Division of vector and scalar
\endcode

- Calculation: +=, -=, *=, /=, |=
\code
a += my_ivec;  // Addition of vectors (a = a+my_ivec)
my_ivec += 10; // Addition of vector and scalar (10)
a -= my_ivec;  // Subtraction of vectors (a = a-my_ivec)
my_ivec -= 10; // Subtraction of vector and scalar (10)
my_ivec *= 10; // Multiplication of vector and scalar (10)
my_ivec /= 10; // Divsion of vector and scalar (10)
my_ivec |= a;  // Element wise division
\endcode

- \c concat
\code
a = concat(my_ivec1, my_ivec2);  // concatenation of two vectors
\endcode


\subsection vector_converters Vector Converters

In order to convert e.g an \c ivec to a \c vec we can write some thing like
\c my_vec = \c to_vec(my_ivec). The following converters are available:
- \c to_bvec,
- \c to_svec,
- \c to_ivec,
- \c to_vec,
- \c to_cvec.


\subsection vector_functions Vector Functions

There are several functions that operate on vectors. Some examples are:
\c max, \c max_index, \c min, \c min_index, \c product, \c energy,
\c geometric_mean, \c mean, \c median, \c norm, \c round, \c variance,
\c ceil_i, \c floor_i, \c round_i, \c find.

Examples of functions that generate different kinds of vectors are:
\c linspace, \c ones_b, \c ones_c, \c ones_i, \c ones \c zeros_b. There
are several more than these. Please refer to the IT++ reference manual
for a description of these.


\section using_matrices Using Matrices

Matrices are two-dimensional arrays, and most of their functionality is
similar to that of vectors. The predefined matrix types are:

- \c mat,
- \c cmat,
- \c imat,
- \c smat,
- \c bmat.

Below follows some examples that are specific for matrices only:

<ul>
<li> Define a matrix of type \c double with 3 rows and 4 columns
\code
mat a(3,4);
\endcode
</li>

<li> Define a matrix of type \c int with 2 rows and 3 columns. A comma (,)
or space is used to separate columns and a semicolon (;) is used to separate
rows.
\code
imat a = "1 2 3;4 5 6";
\endcode
</li>

<li> Access to rows and columns with \c get_row and \c get_col
\code
a.get_row(1); // Returns the second row of the matrix b
a.get_col(0); // Returns the first column of the matrix b
\endcode
</li>

<li> Set rows and columns with \c set_row and \c set_col
\code
a.set_row(1,"9 8 7"); // Set second row to "9 8 7"
a.set_col(0,"7 2");   // Set first column to "7 2"
\endcode
</li>

<li> The size of a matrix
\code
// Set the size. "false" means "do not copy"
a.set_size(4,5,false);
int nr_of_rows = a.rows();    // return the number of rows
int nr_of_columns = a.cols(); // return the number of columns
\endcode
</li>

<li> Access to parts of a matrix
\code
a(r,c); // Access to a single element.
a(i);   // Access to a single element. Linear addressing, by rows.

// Returns the sub-matrix from rows r1 to r2 and columns c1 to c2.
a(r1,r2,c1,c2);
\endcode
</li>

<li> Copy rows and columns
\code
// Copy row number "from" to row number "to"
a.copy_row(to,from)

// Copy column number "from" to column number "to"
a.copy_col(to,from)
\endcode
</li>

<li> Swap rows and columns
\code
// Swap rows number r1 and r2
a.swap_rows(r1,r2)

// Swap columns number c1 and c2
a.swap_cols(c1,c2)
\endcode
</li>

<li> Horizontal and vertical concatenation
\code
// Equivalent to the MATLAB command c = [a b]
c = concat_horizontal(a,b);

// Equivalent to the MATLAB command c = [a;b]
c = concat_vertical(a,b);
\endcode
</li>
</ul>

using namespace itpp;
using namespace std;

int main() {
  long sum = 0;
  Real_Timer my_timer;

  my_timer.tic();
  for (int i=0; i<10000000; i++) {
    sum += i;
  }
  my_timer.toc_print();

  cout << "The sum is " << sum << endl;

  return 0;
}
\endcode


\section itfile_class Reading and Writing to Files

The following example saves the variable \a a to the file
\c my_file_name.it:

\code
#include <itpp/itbase.h>

using namespace itpp;

int main() {
  it_file my_file("my_file_name.it");
  vec a = "1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0";
  my_file << Name("a") << a;

  return 0;
}
\endcode

The following example reads the variable \a a from the file
\c my_file_name.it and prints it:
\code
#include <itpp/itbase.h>

using namespace itpp;
using namespace std;

int main() {
  it_file my_file("my_file_name.it");
  vec a;
  my_file >> Name("a") >> a;
  cout << "a = " << a << endl;

  return 0;
}
\endcode

Note that <tt>*.it</tt> files can be read and written in Matlab/Octave by
using the \c itload.m and \c itsave.m functions.

Also available is the class \c it_ifile that can only be used for reading of
files.
