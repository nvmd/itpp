\page rayleigh Generating a correlated Rayleigh fading process

In this example we will generate a correlated Rayleigh fading process with a
normaized Doppler frequency equal to 0.1. The normalized Doppler is defined
as the multiplication of the maximum Doppler frequency by the sampling time
(i.e. \f$f_d = F_d T_s\f$).

\include rayleigh.cpp

You can use Matlab or Octave to examine the channel fading process that is
stored int the output file \c rayleigh_test.it. Try the followigh code to
view a part of the fading process:

\code
itload("rayleigh_test.it")
figure(1); clf;
semilogy(abs(ch_coeffs(1:200)))
\endcode

Note: Make sure that the folder <tt>$PREFIX/share/itpp</tt> is included your
Matlab/Octave path variable (\c $PREFIX is the IT++ installation prefix:
<tt>/usr/local</tt> by default).
