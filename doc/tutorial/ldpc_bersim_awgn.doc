\page ldpc_bersim_awgn Simulation of LDPC codes the AWGN channel

This program simulates the performance of LDPC codes on the AWGN channel. Since the channel is symmetric, the zero codeword is used.

\include ldpc_bersim_awgn.cpp
To simulate the code "RU_10000.it" over a range of SNR (see \ref ldpc_gen_codes for how to generate codec)
\code
./ldpc_bersim_awgn RU_10000.it
\endcode

To simulate at Eb/N0=1.1 dB
\code
./ldpc_bersim_awgn RU_10000.it 1.1
\endcode
