\page bpsk BPSK modulation over an AWGN channel

As a first example we will generate a sequence of 500000 random bits {0,1} and
BPSK modulate these. Thereafter the BPSK signals will be transmitted over
an AWGN channel with a signal-to-noise ratio \f$E_b/N_0 = 0\f$ dB. The received signal
is then decoded and the number of bit errors are calculated.

\include bpsk.cpp

When you run this program, the output will look something like this:

\include bpsk.ref
